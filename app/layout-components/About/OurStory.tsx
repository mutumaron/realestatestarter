      In 2013, Unsplash launched as a Tumblr blog with 10 high-resolution photos that could be used for anything.

      <p className='text-gray-500'>We’re building a community where the principles of sharing and openness have taken the place of copyright and red tape. Instead of photos being hoarded and shut down, photos on Unsplash are given as fuel for creativity.</p>
